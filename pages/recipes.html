        <h3 style="text-align: left; padding-bottom: 10px;">1. Roasted Turkey<br>
            Ingredients:<br>
            1 whole turkey (12–14 pounds)<br>
            1/4 cup olive oil or melted butter<br>
            2 teaspoons salt<br>
            1 teaspoon black pepper<br>
            1 onion, quartered<br>
            1 lemon, quartered<br>
            1 bunch fresh thyme<br>
            1 bunch fresh rosemary<br>
            4 garlic cloves, smashed<br>
            2 cups chicken broth (for basting)<br>
            Instructions:<br>
            Prep the turkey: Preheat your oven to 325°F (165°C). Remove the giblets and pat the turkey dry with paper towels.<br>
            Season the turkey: Rub the turkey all over with olive oil or melted butter. Season generously with salt and pepper. Stuff the cavity with onion, lemon, thyme, rosemary, and garlic.<br>
            Roast the turkey: Place the turkey breast-side up on a roasting rack in a large pan. Pour chicken broth into the bottom of the pan. Roast, basting occasionally with the pan juices, for about 3 to 3.5 hours (15 minutes per pound), or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F in the thickest part of the thigh.<br>
            Rest before carving: Let the turkey rest for 20 minutes before carving.<br><br>
            2. Creamy Mashed Potatoes<br>
            Ingredients:<br>
            2 pounds potatoes (Yukon Gold or Russet)<br>
            1/2 cup butter<br>
            1/2 cup heavy cream<br>
            Salt and pepper to taste<br>
            1/4 cup sour cream (optional, for extra creaminess)<br>
            Instructions:<br>
            Cook the potatoes: Peel and cut potatoes into chunks. Boil in salted water for 15-20 minutes, or until fork-tender.<br>
            Mash the potatoes: Drain and return potatoes to the pot. Add butter, heavy cream, and sour cream (if using). Mash with a potato masher or electric mixer until smooth and creamy.<br>
            Season: Add salt and pepper to taste. Keep warm until serving.<br><br>
            3. Classic Stuffing<br>
            Ingredients:<br>
            1 loaf of day-old bread (cut into cubes)<br>
            1/2 cup butter<br>
            1 onion, chopped<br>
            2 celery stalks, chopped<br>
            2 garlic cloves, minced<br>
            2 cups chicken broth<br>
            1 teaspoon dried sage<br>
            1 teaspoon dried thyme<br>
            1/2 teaspoon salt<br>
            1/2 teaspoon black pepper<br>
            1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped (optional)<br>
            1/2 cup chopped pecans or walnuts (optional)<br>
            Instructions:<br>
            Prep the bread: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Spread bread cubes on a baking sheet and toast for 10 minutes until dry.<br>
            Cook the vegetables: In a large skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Add onion, celery, and garlic and sauté until softened (about 5-7 minutes).<br>
            Combine: In a large bowl, mix the toasted bread cubes with the sautéed vegetables, chicken broth, sage, thyme, salt, and pepper. Add nuts and parsley if desired.<br>
            Bake: Transfer the stuffing mixture to a greased baking dish and bake for 30-40 minutes, until golden and crispy on top.<br><br>
            4. Homemade Cranberry Sauce<br>
            Ingredients:<br>
            12 ounces fresh or frozen cranberries<br>
            1 cup sugar<br>
            1/2 cup orange juice<br>
            1/2 teaspoon orange zest (optional)<br>
            Instructions:<br>
            Cook the cranberries: In a medium saucepan, combine cranberries, sugar, and orange juice. Bring to a boil over medium heat, then reduce to a simmer.<br>
            Simmer: Cook, stirring occasionally, for 10-15 minutes, until the cranberries burst and the sauce thickens. Add orange zest if desired.<br>
            Cool: Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature. It will thicken further as it cools.<br><br>
            5. Green Bean Casserole<br>
            Ingredients:<br>
            1 pound fresh green beans, trimmed (or use 2 cans of green beans)<br>
            1 can (10.5 oz) cream of mushroom soup<br>
            1/2 cup milk<br>
            1 teaspoon soy sauce (optional)<br>
            1/2 teaspoon garlic powder<br>
            1/2 teaspoon onion powder<br>
            1 1/2 cups crispy fried onions (divided)<br>
            Instructions:<br>
            Prep the green beans: If using fresh green beans, blanch them in boiling water for 4-5 minutes, then drain and set aside.<br>
            Make the sauce: In a large mixing bowl, combine the cream of mushroom soup, milk, soy sauce, garlic powder, and onion powder. Stir in half of the fried onions.<br>
            Combine and bake: Add the green beans to the soup mixture and stir to coat. Transfer to a greased baking dish. Bake at 350°F (175°C) for 25 minutes.<br>
            Top and serve: Remove from the oven, stir, and top with the remaining fried onions. Return to the oven for an additional 5-10 minutes, until the onions are golden brown.<br><br>
            Serving Suggestions:<br>
            Turkey: Carve and serve with gravy made from the pan drippings.<br>
            Mashed potatoes: Serve with extra butter or gravy on top.<br>
            Stuffing: Pair with turkey or enjoy on its own.<br>
            Cranberry sauce: Serve alongside turkey or mashed potatoes for a tangy contrast.<br>
